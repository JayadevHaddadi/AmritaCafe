# AmritaCafe

A simple android cafe order management application specifically made to connect the HP 10 TABLET with two Epson TM-m30 printers.
It might also work for other configurations.
We made this app to be used in our ashram cafe in Amritapuri.
It is currently being used daily and works very well.
We connected the printer to a router with a TP cable and had the tablet connected to the router on wifi.
