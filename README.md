# AmritaCafe

This is a simple cafe application specifically made to connect the HP 10 TABLET with the Eposon TM-m30.
It might also work for other configurations.
We made this app to be used in our ashram cafe in Amritapuri.
It is currently being used daily and works very well.
Our configuration was to have a router connected to the printer with TP cable and the tablet connected to the router on wifi.
